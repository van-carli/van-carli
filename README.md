My name is Vanessa, I'm a software developer with a passion for classical ballet ðŸ©°, active participant in volunteer work, and passionate about playing the guitar ðŸŽ¶!

My journey led me to the field of programming, where I recently began my studies in Back-End Software Development as a scholarship recipient from iFood, through the Cubos Academy platform!
